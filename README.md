# Date-of-SIE-Extreme-Episodes
The project aims to provide the dates of the Antarctic Sea Ice extent (SIE) extreme occurrence from 1989 to the present. A specific day or event was classified as extreme when the SIE value, exceeded or fell below the threshold of plus or minus 2 std relative to daily SIE anomalies. Therefore, days whose SIE value was less than minus 2 std were considered extreme minimum SIE events (SIEmin), whereas those in which the value exceeded plus 2 std were categorized as maximum extreme SIE (SIEmax). A statistical significance test for these events was done, and almost all SIE episodes demonstrated statistical significance in the Student's t-test at a 95\% confidence level (see the column [Sgnf95]).
